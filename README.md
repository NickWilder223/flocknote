# Human-Level-LLM-Generating-[buzzword, buzzword, buzzword]-Dad-Joke-Training-Helper

Have you ever wanted to contribute to LLM's learning models? Here at Flocknote we have the perfect opportunity!

You will recieve a series of Dad Jokes and your job is to rate them with either a thumbs up (üëç) or a face palm (ü§¶). 
This will help our future AI overlords complete a more seamless experience when communicating with the Dad's of Flocknote.

Your participation is not mandatory, but would be very appreciated!
